# Pepito_ITCC40_Portfolio_Replit
ere’s a simple, step-by-step tutorial to run your Resume Portfolio app on Windows. You can copy and paste each command into your terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) in the project directory.

1. Open your terminal and go to your project folder
   
** example: cd "C:\Users\remwe\Downloads\ResumePortfolio" **

2. Install all dependencies

**npm install**

3. Start the development server

**npm run dev**

4. Open your browser and go to

[http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1):5000
That’s it!
Your app should now be running locally. If you make changes to your code, the server will automatically reload.

Note:
If you see errors about environment variables, make sure cross-env is installed (it is if you followed the steps above).
If you want to stop the server, press Ctrl + C in your terminal.
